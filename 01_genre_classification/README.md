# Music-Genre-Classification-with-GTZAN-Dataset


### About Me
My name is April Qianyun Li, currently a student of Master in Data Science at the University of San Francisco.

### Project Description
This repository is about classifying 10 genres of 1000 tracks(balanced, 100 tracks per genre) with accuracy score.
The data used is the 30 second version from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification

* The main notebook "Genre_Classification.ipynb" is the one with Machine Learning process, including data preprocessing, feature engineering(feature transformation and feature selection), model selection and evaluation.

* The supported notebook "Music_Features.ipynb" is a visualization of 10 genres to show what the features in our dataset mean.

You can also watch a presentation about this project via youtube.

### Outcome
* PCA helps us to reduce the model from 57 features to 13 components
* A final random forest model has been chosen with an accuracy score 0.65 on test dataset.
